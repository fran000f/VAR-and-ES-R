# VAR-and-ES-R
Calculations of VAR and ES for three indices with R Markdown (in Polish)

The program takes data regarding three stock market indices (dane.csv) and calculates the 95% VaR (Value at Risk) and ES (Expected Shortfall) values for them, using Monte Carlo simulation and and an EWMA (Exponentially Weighted Moving Average) model. In the next step, statistcal tests of significance for these values get conducted and their results displayed along with some charts illustrating the 95% VaR and ES value changes over time for all indiices.
